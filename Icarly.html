        <h2><b>Ma'am Joy's huge milestone</b></h2>
        <h2>By Icarly Miane B. Mariano</h2>

        <p>Our dear principal, Ma’am Joy M. Paredes has reached a huge milestone<br>
             for the past 24 years of handling our school which she grew together with. For the past years,<br>
              Ma’am Joy had met and shared an educational journey to different students that became part of<br>
               the KWLC family. Every teacher, every staff and every student are always welcome to be part<br>
                of the wonderful community Ma’am Joy created.This long journey was never that easy because<br>
                 it takes a lot of time, work, and patience to handle a school and to own one. Ma’am Joy<br>
                  tried to balance everything with the help and support from the parents, teachers and<br>
                  staff. Ma’am Joy also shared her expertise in the field of teaching way back in the<br>
                   year 1986, at the school of St. Louis College of Solano (formerly known as St. Louis School),<br>
                    which was her alma mater. She also shared that she handled kindergarten class with 48 pupils<br>
                     per section (2 kinder sessions) on her first year. Teaching at SLS was like a homecoming for her<br>
                      because some of her grade school and high school teachers were still around back then. She was also<br>
                       asked before by her student and her quick and ready response was, “to have my own school someday.”<br>
                        Her dream came into fruition after 14 years when she put up KIDS WORKSHOP LEARNING CENTER in June<br>
                         of year 2000. She credited her family, friends and former pupils who have supported her all the<br> 
                         way. She believes that once a child can read and give meaning to the words, learning can be easy.<br>
                          She hopes to be in the field of study for a long time – Soaring high and touching lives.<br>
            Ma’am Joy has also taught, created and formed such a wonderful community that started small and grew bigger.<br>
             She hopes to share all positive and good things to everyone even though some people can be mean and negative.<br> 
            May we continue dreaming because those dreams will come true if we work hard enough and never give up.</p>
