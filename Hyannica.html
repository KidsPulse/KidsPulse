        <p>KWLC's representative for badminton singles,<br>
             Averie Frances Calauad was announced as 1st runner up in the badminton<br>
              singles event in the recent Solano 2 District Sports Meet held in Brgy. San Juan,<br>
               Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. During the first set, Averie Frances scored 21 points while<br>
                the opposing player garnered 18 points. The first set was a struggle because Averie<br>
                 was nervous but since her best Friends, teachers and coach were rooting for her she<br>
                  was able to catch up. We all saw Averie's determination to win this for KWLC. On the<br>
                   second set, there was still a little bit of nervousness but since she won the first set,<br>
                    it gave her the confidence to win. Her score was 21 points and the opposing team had 11 points.<br>
            Although Averie only had a limited time to train, she was able to put in a good work for this year's<br>
             district meet. Your KWLC family is proud of you Averie Frances.</p>
